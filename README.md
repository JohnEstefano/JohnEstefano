<h2>🛠 Data Engineering Projects</h2>
<h3> PROJECT SPARKIFY: Showcases my iterative data engineering skills. Each step increases the robustness of the data pipeline by adding an extra layer of functionally.</h3>

A startup called Sparkify wanted to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team was particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. 

[Step 1](https://github.com/JohnEstefano/POSTGRES_Data_Modeling): Their data resided in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. So, I created Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. Along with a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

[Step 2](https://github.com/JohnEstefano/APACHE_CASSANDRA_Data_Modeling):  Their data resided in a directory of CSV files and they wanted the solution to have scalability and high availability with compromising performance. So, I created an Apache Cassandra database.

[Step 3](https://github.com/JohnEstefano/AWS_Data_Warehouse): Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and wants to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. So, I built an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights.

[Step 4](https://github.com/JohnEstefano/AWS_Data_Lake): Adds Apache Spark to increase the pipeline’s data processing ability so it can handle large scale data processing.

[Step 5](https://github.com/JohnEstefano/AIRFLOW_Data_Pipeline): Adds Apache Airflow in the mix to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines.

<h3> PROJECT CHICAGO TRANSIT: Showcases my realtime event streaming skills by using Apache Kafka.</h3>

<h3> PROJECT SMARTSHEET: Showcases my ability to build a solution that incorporates Developer APIs.</h3>
It interacts with both a MySql database and Smartsheet API and has a very specific usecase that takes data from database, modifies it in a very specific way then updates specified Smartsheet sheet.
